#My Answer for practice 1

#Asks for and stores names in variables

name = raw_input("What is you name, human? ")
age = raw_input("How long have you lived? ")
live = raw_input("Where do you live? ")
decide = raw_input("Were you born there? ")

#If you chose no or yes then it prints depending on your answer
#Python is case sensitive 

if decide == "no" or decide == "No":
    born = raw_input("Where were you born?")
    print "So, you are %s "%(name) + str(age) +" born in %s, but live in %s"  %(born,live)
else:
    print "So, you are %s " %(name) + str(age) +" years old, born and live in %s" %(live)
