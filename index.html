          <p>Women Who Code (WWCode) is global non-profit dedicated to inspiring women to excel in technology careers. We work to support this generation in being and becoming leaders and role models in the tech industry.

WWCode Matters to Women.
Software development is one of the fastest growing job sectors in the world economy and it is projected to grow by 23%. These careers pay well with a median income that is 42% higher than other jobs.
<br>
<br>
WWCode Matters to the Tech Industry.
Diverse teams perform better by increasing collective intelligence and companies with the highest representation of women leadership have seen a 34% higher ROI than those with few or no women.
<br>
<br>
WWCode Matters to the World.
When women make more, they reinvest 90% of their income back into their families and communities, thus creating a virtuous cycle or multiplier effect for supporting women to earn more overall.</p>
